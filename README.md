*Need to visualize a rather large (gigabytes+) raster?* **This is for you.**

A Python package for serving tiles from large raster files in
the [Slippy Maps standard](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames)
(i.e., `/zoom/x/y.png`) for visualization in Jupyter with `ipyleaflet` or `folium`.

Launch a [demo](https://github.com/banesullivan/localtileserver-demo) on MyBinder [![MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/banesullivan/localtileserver-demo/HEAD)

Documentation: https://localtileserver.banesullivan.com/

Under the hood, this is also a Flask blueprint/application for use as a
standalone web app or in your own web deployments needing dynamic tile serving.


## 🌟 Highlights

- Launch a tile server for large geospatial images
- View local or remote* raster files with `ipyleaflet` or `folium` in Jupyter
- View rasters with CesiumJS with the built-in web application

**remote raster files should be pre-tiled Cloud Optimized GeoTiffs*

## 🚀 Usage

Usage details and examples can be found in the documentation: https://localtileserver.banesullivan.com/

The following is a minimal example to visualize a local raster file with
`ipyleaflet`:

```py
from localtileserver import get_leaflet_tile_layer, TileClient
from ipyleaflet import Map

# First, create a tile server from local raster file
client = TileClient('path/to/geo.tif')

# Create ipyleaflet tile layer from that server
t = get_leaflet_tile_layer(client)

m = Map(center=client.center(), zoom=client.default_zoom)
m.add(t)
m
```

## ℹ️ Overview

The `TileClient` class can be used to to launch a tile server in a background
thread which will serve raster imagery to a viewer (usually `ipyleaflet` or
`folium` in Jupyter notebooks).

This tile server can efficiently deliver varying resolutions of your
raster imagery to your viewer; it helps to have pre-tiled,
[Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs)](https://www.cogeo.org/).

There is an included, standalone web viewer leveraging
[CesiumJS](https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/).


## ⬇️ Installation

Get started with `localtileserver` to view rasters in Jupyter or deploy as your
own Flask application.

### 🐍 Installing with `conda`

Conda makes managing `localtileserver`'s dependencies across platforms quite
easy and this is the recommended method to install:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge localtileserver
```

### 🎡 Installing with `pip`

If you prefer pip, then you can install from PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/localtileserver/

```
pip install localtileserver
```
